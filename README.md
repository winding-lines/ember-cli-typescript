# TypeScript support for ember-cli
Adds precompilation of TypeScript files and all the basic generation
types to the `ember generate` command.

It was inspired (and forked from) the CoffeeScript addon (https://github.com/kimroen/ember-cli-coffeescript).

Note: This is under development and probably doesn't work as expected. PRs welcome!

### Includes
- Generating files in TypeScript with `ember generate`
- Preprocessing TypeScript-files in your app

### Install
```
ember install:addon ember-cli-typescript
```

**NB**: This addon requires ember-cli version `0.2.0-beta.1` and up.
